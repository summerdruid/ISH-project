		Bob made a new years resolution to loose weight and has decided to do so by taking up jogging. To help monitor his performance he bought a wearable tracker and he 
		would like to be able to get some basic feel-good stats, such as average distance run per day. Bob is not generally a tech fan and wants the interface to be as 		simple as possible.
