Name: Janice Smith
Age: 31

Janice is a casual runner. She goes on runs regularly at the weekends to keep in shape and has been doing so for about a month now. Having noticed improvment in her fitness, she has decided to use an app to track her progress and see her improvement in more detail. She wants to see a record of her times to help descide if she should take on more strenuous runs or not.

In addition, Janice would like to compare her results to those of her friends to check how their fitness compares and motivate them (or her) to exercise more.
